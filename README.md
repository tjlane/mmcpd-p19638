Code employed during and for subsequent analysis of the SwissFEL beamtime p19638, led by the Lane group (DESY, Hamburg, DE). This beamtime executed pump-probe crystallography of the CPD photolyase from M. mazei. Code is provided "as-is" for the purpose of transparency and reproducability, without any warranty. Code was not intended to presist beyond the scope of the specific scientfic project, so is not actively maintained nor extensively documented.
